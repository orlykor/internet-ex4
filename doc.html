    <p> our tester.js (based on the published one) checks several things: </p>
        <li> Fills the data model with resources and request handlers</li>
        <li>
             <p> Sends requests to the server and checks whether the matching between them and the resources is good,</p>
             <p> and also checks if we got the data we wanted with matching request handler.</p>
        </li>
        <li> Checks the static server </li>
