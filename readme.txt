1. what was hard in this ex. was the asynchronous because it was hard to
debug the program.
also, we got a problem that in linux the program ran perfectly
but then in windows, on our laptops the program filed.
it was hard to understand that it was because the data was sent
through the socket in 2 parts on our laptops, so we didnt handle
 it right.

 2. the part fun was to see that we have passed all the tests.
 it was also fun to see how it actually works, the server and all the
 http requests and response.
